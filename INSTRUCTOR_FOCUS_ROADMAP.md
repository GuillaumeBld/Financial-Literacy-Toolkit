## üéØ Priority 1: Fix Current Dashboard

### Task 1.1: Fix Syntax Errors in Dashboard
**File**: `apps/web/src/app/instructor/dashboard/page.tsx`

```typescript
const handleRefresh = () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem;  // Missing parentheses
  if (token) {
    loadDashboardData(token, selectedCourse);
  }
;  // Unexpected semicolon
```

**Fix**: Add parentheses and remove extra semicolon
```typescript
const handleRefresh = () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('instructor-token');
  if (token) {
    loadDashboardData(token, selectedCourse);
  }
};
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Queries Needed

**Get Instructor's Students**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  u.hashed_student_key,
  COUNT(a.attempt_id) as attempt_count,
  MAX(a.submitted_at) as last_attempt
FROM users u
JOIN enrollments e ON u.user_id = e.user_id
JOIN instructor_courses ic ON e.course_id = ic.course_id
LEFT JOIN attempts a ON u.user_id = a.user_id
WHERE ic.instructor_id = ?
GROUP BY u.hashed_student_key
```

**Get Student Attempts**:
```sql
SELECT 
  a.attempt_id,
  a.attempt_type,
  a.submitted_at,
  a.duration_s,
  s.overall as score,
  s.by_domain,
  s.overconfidence_index
FROM attempts a
JOIN users u ON a.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN scores s ON a.attempt_id = s.attempt_id
WHERE u.hashed_student_key = ?
ORDER BY a.submitted_at DESC
```

**Calculate Domain Averages**:
```sql
SELECT 
  i.domain,
  AVG(CASE WHEN i.type = 'multiple-choice' THEN 
    (CASE WHEN r.raw_answer->>'selected' = i.key THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
  ELSE 
    COALESCE(r.score, 0.5)
  END) as avg_score,
  COUNT(*) as response_count
FROM items i
JOIN responses r ON i.item_id = r.item_id
JOIN attempts a ON r.attempt_id = a.attempt_id
WHERE a.course_id = ?
GROUP BY i.domain
```
